This is a multi-user canvas. 
Multiple users can draw simutaneously and collaborate to finish a picture. 
Colors and stroke sizes can be changed and synchronized to other users.
Users can clear the canvas.

Right click to add images from your computer or the Internet.
  - For local images: copy the path of your image.
  - For images online: copy the link (url) of your image.
  - A user can drag the picture on the canvas.

Users can use gestures to trigger some events.
  - Draw a circle to launch the searching bar.
  - Draw a pigtail to close the searching bar.
  - Draw a cross to request closing the window.
    
To run the project:
  - "cd" the project repository.
  - "node app.js".
  - Open a browser and enter "http://127.0.0.1:8080" (or type the server's IP address).
  
There are some parts that we can ameliorate:
  - Add a specific area to draw gestures to avoid conflicts.
  - Synchronize the inserted image to other users.
  - Right click on the canvas to add text.
